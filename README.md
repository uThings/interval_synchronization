This repository contains the graphs used for the experiments discussed in the paper "Distributed Interval Synchronization", by Andrea Fusiello and Pier Luca Montessoro, IEEE Access 2023 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373832).

As described in the paper, the graphs are grouped into 6 sets based on the number of nodes and the average cyclomatic number. Each set has 50 random graphs.

The graphs were generated by Octave (https://octave.sourceforge.io/) in the Networks Toolbox format (https://github.com/aeolianine/octave-networks-toolbox). The format for the edge labels is based on the Interval Package (https://octave.sourceforge.io/interval/package_doc/).

Note that the edge labels are directed, that is, there are separate values (although identical in the dataset graphs) for the labels from node A to B and from B to A.
